# Project Name: Blog Platform

This is a simple blog platform built with React, allowing users to sign up, log in, create posts, and explore content across various categories. It uses React for the front end and communicates with a backend server to handle user registration, authentication, and post creation.

## Features

- **User Registration and Authentication:** Allows users to sign up, log in, and log out.
- **Create and View Posts:** Users can create new posts and view them by category.
- **User Profile:** Displays the user's information and posts.
- **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Dynamic Navbar:** The navigation bar adjusts based on the user's authentication status.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: For navigation between different pages in the application.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend.
- **CSS**: For styling the front-end.
- **Context API**: For managing user authentication state globally.
- **React Icons**: For using icon components like the navigation bar toggle.
- **Backend**: Express.js (assuming you have a backend API for user authentication and post management).
